# Overview

## Title
The title of the software paper should focus on the software, e.g. “Text mining software from the X project”. If the software is closely linked to a specific research paper, then “Software from Paper Title” is appropriate. The title should be factual, relating to the functionality of the software and the area it relates to rather than making claims about the software, e.g. “Easy-to-use”.

## Abstract
A short (ca. 100 word) summary of the software being described: what problem the software addresses, how it was implemented and architected, where it is stored, and its reuse potential.

Survey data harmonization refers to procedures that improve the data comparability or the inferential capacity of multiple surveys conducted in different periods of time, or in different geographical locations, using different languages. The retroharmonize package support various data processing, documentation, file/type conversion aspects of various survey harmonization workflows.

## Keywords
keyword 1; keyword 2; etc.
Keywords should make it easy to identify who and what the software will be useful for.

## Introduction 
An overview of the software, how it was produced, and the research for which it has been used, including references to relevant research articles. A short comparison with software which implements similar functionality should be included in this section. 

Surveys, i.e., systematic primary observation and data collections are important data sources of both social and natural sciences. Survey data harmonization refers to procedures that improve the data comparability or the inferential capacity of multiple surveys conducted in different periods of time, or in different geographical locations, using different languages. The retroharmonize R package support various data processing, documentation, file/type conversion aspects of various survey harmonization workflows. The software was developed and tested with social sciences surveys using questionnaires, but various other surveying modes (inflation surveys with price scanning, […]) could be harmonized with our approach.

Various R packages support aspects of the workflow of survey harmonization. 

Importing data from survey files (containing numeric codes and value labels), harmonizing concepts, then variables, labels, and coding, and eventually bringing them to the same variable types for binding or joining into a single, tidy dataset.  The haven package in the tidyverse imports single SPSS and STATA files (which are almost always used for social sciences surveys.)  The haven package is in turn builds on the labelled package for using variables that have both numeric and labelled representations. Whilst haven and label work perfectly with single surveys, they do not crosscheck the potential conflicts of conflicting labels, particularly conflicting special and missing value labels across files. We created inherited classes from these packages that create truly unique identifiers across several files and contain methods that prevent type conversion logical or syntax errors with inconsistent labelling.

“Data is only potential information without metadata”. This statement is painfully clear when you work with several surveys, which may contain the measurement of the same concept in differently named variables, held in different file types, using different numerical codes, value labels, and conflicting special characters. Retroharmonize extents the tidyverse packages for consistently mapping the imbedded metadata of various SPSS, STATA or even CSV files, and use this information for systematically change the names of variables, xxxx,xxxx.

There are several R packages that do a similar job, but have a less ambitious aim. Xxxxx., xxxxxx, xxxxx.




## Implementation and architecture
How the software was implemented, with details of the architecture where relevant. Use of relevant diagrams is appropriate. Please also describe any variants and associated implementation differences.

Retroharmonize was developed over several years with implementing more and more harmonization tasks in various ex ante harmonized surveys, starting with the European Eurobarometer series, then adding Afrobarometer, Lationbarometro and private surveys. These international survey research programs provide access to their harmonized surveys in “waves”. Usually, they call a way a set of ex ante harmonized surveys (containing the same questionnaire in several languages) in one data collection period. Our added value has been that we further harmonize data among waves (when data is not fully ex ante harmonized and requires ex post or retrospective harmonization.)



## Quality control 
Detail the level of testing that has been carried out on the code (e.g. unit, functional, load etc.), and in which environments. If not already included in the software documentation, provide details of how a user could quickly understand if the software is working (e.g. providing examples of running the software with sample input and output data). 

Retroharmonize was extensively tested on privately conducted surveys, and three large, international, ex ante harmonized survey programs (questionnaire-based social science research aimed for ex post or retrospective harmonization across countries and years): Eurobarometer, Afrobarometer and Latinobarometro. 

For unit testing, we included in the R package three subsets of published Eurobarometer surveys. The package’s unit testing consists of about 130-unit tests made with this real-life survey excepts.


# Availability 

## Operating system
Please include minimum version compatibility.

## Programming language
Please include minimum version compatibility.

## Additional system requirements
E.g. memory, disk space, processor, input devices, output devices.



## Dependencies
E.g. libraries, frameworks, incl. minimum version compatibility.

The retroharmonize R package is practically a very thorough extension of the R tidyverse packages: it depends on haven (and labelled) for working with coded survey files. It uses dplyr, tidyr (and their common, deep level rlang, vctrs) dependencies for variable manipulation within a single survey (preparation for harmonization) and purrr for functional programming task with several surveys. 

## List of contributors

# Reuse potential 
Please describe in as much detail as possible the ways in which the software could be reused by other researchers both within and outside of your field. This should include the use cases for the software, and also details of how the software might be modified or extended (including how contributors should contact you) if appropriate. Also you must include details of what support mechanisms are in place for this software (even if there is no support).

The retroharmonize R package aims to provide a versatile support for various survey harmonization workflows. Because surveys are so fundamental to quantitative social science research and play an important role in many natural science fields, not to mention commercial applications of market research or pharmaceutical research, the package’s main reuse potential is to be a foundation of further reproducible research software aimed to automate research and harmonization aspects of specific survey programs.

The authors of this package started the development work to be able to harmonize surveys from harmonized data collections of the European Union: namely the Eurobarometer and AES surveys programs.  After working with various surveys (also outside these programs) it became clear that retroharmoinze should aim to be a common demoninator to a family of similar software that solves more specific problems.  The world’s largest and oldest international public policy survey series, Eurobarometer.  This program alone has conducted already thousands of surveys in more than 20 natural languages over more than 40 years, following various documentation, data management, coding practices that were not independent of the software tools available over this long period of time.  The first verion of retroharmonize was separated to the retroharmonize and the eurobarometer R packages – retroharmonize providing a more general framework that has been able to serve Eurobarometer’s, Afrobarometer’s and the Arab Barometer’s different needs. 

In our view, the retroharmonize package has the potential to become a general supporting software for more specific codes aimed at harmonizing surveys based first on questionnaires, later on different data inputs, such as price scanning, laboratory tests, and other standardized, discrete inputs that are carried out in different locations, with different recording tools, and with different coding (for example, because of natural languages differences, as it is the case in the social science surveys used for the testing of our software.)
